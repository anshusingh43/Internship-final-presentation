# Internship-final-presentation
I did my internship in Arthmetis where I worked for Bridgetree ( their client ) as a Data scientist Intern. My role was to research and provide solution for data preparation, model building and deployment in the Azure cloud environment and Redpoint Integration. I also did some research to find the best platform to work with my code. 

It was a great experience working there as I get to know how exactly things run in an industry with data Science people and the start to end process it takes to work on a project.
